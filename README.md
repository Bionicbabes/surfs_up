# **Overview of the analysis**

----------------------------------

* W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# **Results**

# **Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June**

* Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

# **Summary**

----------------------------------

* Looking at the Temperature data we can see that the from June to December the mean temperature only decreasing by four degreee ( 75 F to 71 F).  With the plans of opening up a surf shop this make for an ideal situation.  We analyize the data even further to see that in both months that standard deviation is between 3.2 to 3.7, meaning that the fluctuation in temperature remains fairly stable.  Investigating a bit further we can look at the max temp and the min temp in June min/max is 64/85, and in December min/max is 56/83.  Given the stablity I would definitely move forward with the surf shop based on temperature analysis.
